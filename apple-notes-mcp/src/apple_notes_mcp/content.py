# Apple Notes — Formatting Capabilities

Apple Notes (Mac, iOS, iCloud) renders rich text from a constrained subset of
HTML. The Notes app stores everything as HTML internally and that's exactly
what you write through this MCP server's `body` parameter. CSS3 is mostly
stripped: rely on semantic tags, not inline styles.

## Paragraph styles

- **Title** — the first line of body is rendered as the title. `create_note`
  automatically prepends `<div>{title}</div>` so do *not* include a title
  line in your `body`. The title is also exposed to AppleScript as the
  note's `name`. See "Title handling — the title IS the first line of body"
  below for the full mental model.
- **Heading** — section header, *also* renders the section as collapsible in
  modern Notes. Use `<h2>`.
- **Subheading** — sub-section. Use `<h3>`.
- **Body** — the default. Use `<div>` or `<p>` for paragraphs.
- **Monospaced** — fixed-width block. Use `<pre>` or `<code>` (best-effort;
  exact rendering is up to Notes).

> Tip: When a note is long, prefer `<h2>` per major section. The Notes UI
> lets the user collapse/expand each `<h2>`-level section, which is great
> for browsable reference notes.

## Inline formatting

- `<b>` or `<strong>` — bold
- `<i>` or `<em>` — italic
- `<u>` — underline
- `<s>` or `<strike>` — strikethrough
- `<a href="...">` — hyperlink
- `<br>` — soft line break inside a paragraph

Inline color, highlight, and font-size changes are not reliably round-tripped
via the AppleScript HTML interface. Don't rely on them.

## Lists

- **Bulleted list** — `<ul><li>…</li></ul>`
- **Numbered list** — `<ol><li>…</li></ol>`
- **Nested list** — nest `<ul>`/`<ol>` inside an `<li>`
- **Dashed list** — Notes-app feature; not addressable via HTML. Use bullets.
- **Checklist** — when authored through this MCP, Notes renders bullet items.
  True interactive checklists with checked/unchecked state must be added
  inside the Notes UI; they are not round-trippable via AppleScript.
  *If the user explicitly asks for a checklist*, use `<ul>` and prefix each
  item with `☐ ` (open) or `☑ ` (done) so the meaning survives, then mention
  the limitation in chat.

## Tables

`<table>`, `<thead>`, `<tbody>`, `<tr>`, `<th>`, `<td>` are supported.
Inline CSS is stripped, so don't bother styling cells. Keep tables narrow
(≤ 4 columns) — Notes' rendering on iPhone is unforgiving.

## Block content

- `<blockquote>` — quoted block (limited styling).
- `<hr>` — horizontal rule, useful as a section divider.
- Images embedded as `<img src="data:image/...">` are typically dropped.
  Don't try to embed images via this MCP; the user adds them in the Notes UI.

## Collapsible sections

Any `<h2>` (Heading) creates a collapsible section: everything between this
`<h2>` and the next `<h2>` collapses under it. Use this aggressively for
long-form notes.

## Title handling — the title IS the first line of body

In Apple Notes the title is not a separate field: it is literally the
**first line of `body`**, rendered bold/large by the editor and exposed
to AppleScript as the `name` property (auto-derived). Every body write
re-derives `name` from the new first line — there is no way around it.

This MCP reflects that model:

- **`create_note(title, body)`** — prepends `<div>{title}</div>` as the
  first line of body. Your `body` should be the **content only**, with
  no title line. Do NOT include `<h1>title</h1>` or `<div>title</div>`
  yourself; the MCP adds it.
- **`update_note(body, title=…)`**:
  - **With `title=…`**: same as create — your `body` is content only;
    the MCP prepends `<div>{title}</div>`. This effectively renames the
    note in addition to rewriting the body.
  - **Without `title=`**: the MCP writes your `body` verbatim. **Your
    body MUST start with a title line** (`<div>{title text}</div>` is
    the canonical form), or the note's title and `name` will silently
    change to whatever the new first line of content is. The simplest
    way to do this is to read `body_html` first and keep the existing
    title line at the top, replacing only the content below it.
- **`rename_note(title)`** — sets `n.name` only, body is not touched.
  This is the **only** rename path that is safe on notes containing
  hidden hyperlinks, but it has a caveat: in modern Notes the title
  shown at the **top of the open note body** is derived from body's
  first line (not from `name`), so that on-screen title will not
  update. The Notes sidebar / list does update because it uses `name`.

### Old notes with a duplicated title

Notes created with earlier versions of this MCP have a duplicated
title in body that looks like:

```
<div>{title}</div>
<div><b><span style="font-size: 24px">{title}</span></b></div>
<div>... content ...</div>
```

When you `update_note` such a note, **collapse the duplicate**: keep
exactly one of those leading title lines (preferably the first
`<div>{title}</div>`) and drop the other.

## Preservation rules (CRITICAL — read before any update)

### Hard limitation: hidden hyperlinks cannot round-trip

Apple's AppleScript bridge does **not** expose `<a href="...">` URLs in
the `body` property. If the user typed a hyperlink in the Notes UI (the
Link button — URL hidden behind a visible label like "click here"),
`get_note` cannot read the URL back. The live note in Notes still has
the link clickable, but writing body back via AppleScript will destroy
it. Only `append_to_note` and `rename_note` are safe on such notes.

See `notes://preservation-rules` for the full decision flow.

### The body_text trap

When **modifying an existing note**, the golden rule is:

> **Always work from `body_html`. Never write back content derived from
> `body_text`.**

`body_text` is a lossy projection of the note. Several elements are
invisible there but visible in the Notes app, and re-writing from plaintext
silently destroys them:

- `<a href="...">visible label</a>` — the URL is hidden behind the label
  text. In `body_text` you only see `visible label`. If you regenerate the
  body from plaintext, **the link is gone**.
- `<b>`, `<i>`, `<u>`, `<s>` — emphasis is invisible in plaintext.
- `<table>` structure — collapses to a flat run of cell text without
  borders, headers, or rows.
- Bullet/numbered list nesting — nesting depth disappears in plaintext.
- Blockquotes, horizontal rules, monospaced blocks — formatting markers
  are stripped.

### Required workflow for ANY update

1. Call `get_note(note_id)` and read **`body_html`** (not `body_text`).
2. Identify everything that must survive your edit. Pay special attention
   to:
   - Every `<a href="...">` — the URL inside `href=` must be preserved
     verbatim, even if you change the surrounding text.
   - Every `<table>`, `<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<blockquote>`, `<pre>`.
   - Inline emphasis (`<b>`, `<i>`, `<u>`, `<s>`).
3. Make a **minimal, targeted edit** to the HTML — change the smallest
   region needed and leave the rest byte-for-byte identical.
4. Prefer `append_to_note` over `update_note` when you're only adding
   content. Append is non-destructive by definition.
5. When `update_note` is unavoidable, the new `body` must be a superset
   of what was there: every link, table, list and emphasis tag from the
   original must reappear in the rewrite, unless the user explicitly
   asked you to remove it.

If you are unsure whether your rewrite preserves everything, **stop and
ask the user** rather than risk losing data.

PRESERVATION_RULES = """\
# Apple Notes — Preservation Rules for Updates

When modifying an existing note (`append_to_note`, `update_note`,
`rename_note`), follow these rules to avoid silently destroying content.
Read this doc **before** producing any edited HTML.

## Hard limitation — hidden hyperlinks cannot round-trip

Apple's AppleScript Notes bridge **does not expose `<a href="...">` URLs**.
If the user typed a hyperlink in the Notes app (e.g. via the Link button —
URL hidden behind visible label text like "click here"), `get_note` will
NOT return the URL. The body comes back with the link converted to plain
underlined text (`<u>label</u>`) or just plain text.

This means:

- **There is no way to know via this MCP whether a note contains hidden
  hyperlinks.** If you suspect it does (because the user mentions "the
  doc link" or similar, or because the body contains language like
  "click here" / "see here" / "the link" with no visible URL), you must
  treat the note as fragile.
- **`update_note` will destroy live hyperlinks.** Even though `get_note`
  doesn't show them, the live note in the Notes app DOES still have
  them clickable. Writing the body back via AppleScript overwrites the
  live representation with the link-stripped version, killing the URLs.
- **`append_to_note` is safe.** It only adds content at the end and
  never touches existing content.
- **`rename_note` is safe.** It only changes the note's `name` property
  and never reads or writes body.

If a note may contain hidden links, the only operations you may perform
are `append_to_note` and `rename_note`. **Do not use `update_note`.**
If the user asks for a body edit on such a note, explain the limitation
and ask them to make the edit inside the Notes app directly (where the
UI preserves hyperlinks).

## The body_text trap

**Always work from `body_html`. Never rewrite a note from `body_text`.**

`body_text` is a lossy projection. The following all look identical to
`body_text` but are very different in the actual note:

| Looks the same in body_text | But the HTML differs |
|---|---|
| `Click here for the docs` | `<a href="https://example.com">Click here for the docs</a>` |
| `Total: 42` | `<b>Total:</b> 42` |
| `A Cell — B Cell` | `<table>…<tr><td>A Cell</td><td>B Cell</td></tr>…</table>` |
| `One Two Three` | `<ul><li>One</li><li><ul><li>Two</li><li>Three</li></ul></li></ul>` |

If you regenerate the body from `body_text`, every link URL, every emphasis
tag, every table cell boundary, every list nesting level **is gone**. The
Notes app will happily save the dumbed-down version and the user's data is
lost.

## Required workflow

1. **Read `body_html`** from `get_note(note_id)`. Ignore `body_text` for
   editing purposes; it's only useful for human-readable summaries.
2. **Decide if the note may contain hidden hyperlinks.** Signals that
   it might:
   - The user refers to "the link", "click here", "the doc", etc.
   - body_text contains label-style phrases without nearby URLs.
   - The note is older / authored in the Notes app rather than via this MCP.
   If yes, **do not call `update_note`**. Use `append_to_note` (for
   additions) or `rename_note` (for title changes), or ask the user to
   edit inside the Notes app directly.
3. **Inventory everything that must survive your edit**, in particular:
   - Every `<a href="...">` (only visible if the note was authored via
     this MCP — Apple's bridge hides UI-authored links).
   - Every `<b>`, `<i>`, `<u>`, `<s>`.
   - Every `<table>`, `<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<li>`, `<blockquote>`, `<pre>`,
     `<hr>`.
   - Existing `<h1>`/`<h2>`/`<h3>` — keep them where they are.
4. **Make the smallest possible edit** to the HTML. Treat the existing
   body as authoritative; only the region the user asked you to change
   should differ.
5. **Prefer `append_to_note`** for additions. It is impossible for append
   to lose existing content.
6. **Prefer `rename_note`** for title-only changes. It does not touch
   body and so cannot destroy hyperlinks.
7. **`update_note` is the dangerous one.** Use it only when you must
   rewrite content in place AND you are confident the note contains no
   hidden hyperlinks. Before calling it:
   - Compare your new body against the original `body_html`.
   - Verify every `<a href="…">` from the original appears (with the same
     URL!) in your output, unless the user explicitly told you to remove
     a specific link.
   - Verify every `<table>`, `<ul>`, `<ol>` is present.
   - If anything is missing and the user didn't ask to remove it, fix
     the rewrite or stop and ask the user.

## When in doubt

Stop and ask. Apple Notes does not have undo across an MCP write — once
you call `update_note`, the previous body is gone. A clarifying question
to the user is far cheaper than data loss.

COMPOSE_NOTE_PROMPT = """\
You are about to create a new Apple Note via the `create_note` tool on this
MCP server.

Before generating the body, **read these resources** so you use formatting
the Notes app actually supports:

- `notes://styleguide` — what Apple Notes supports and how to think about it.
- `notes://html-reference` — exact HTML snippets you can use in the `body`.
- `notes://templates/meeting`, `notes://templates/checklist`,
  `notes://templates/longform`, `notes://templates/table` — pick the closest
  template and adapt it.

When composing the note:

1. **Pick the right template** based on the user's intent (a meeting log, a
   reference doc, a TODO list, a comparison table, etc.). If the request is
   short and unstructured, prefer the long-form template with at most one or
   two `<h2>` sections.
2. **Use semantic structure** — `<h2>` for collapsible sections, `<ul>`/`<ol>`
   for lists, `<table>` for tabular data. **Do NOT include the note title
   in `body`** (no `<h1>title</h1>`, no leading `<div>title</div>`). The
   `create_note` tool prepends the title as the first line of body
   automatically; including it again produces a duplicated title.
3. **Escape user content**: `&` → `&amp;`, `<` → `&lt;`, `>` → `&gt;`. Replace
   newlines in plain text with `<br>` or wrap each line in `<div>`.
4. **Keep it scannable** — short paragraphs, lists over walls of text, tables
   for anything comparative.
5. **Avoid unsupported formatting** — no inline CSS, no embedded images, no
   custom fonts/colors. If the user wants a true interactive checklist,

   to convert it inside the Notes app for tap-to-check behavior.

EXPAND_NOTE_PROMPT = """\
You are about to expand or update an existing Apple Note (via
`append_to_note` or `update_note`).

## Step 0 — read the rules that prevent data loss

Before doing ANYTHING else, load and read this resource end-to-end:

- `notes://preservation-rules`

It explains why you must work from `body_html` (never `body_text`) and
exactly what to preserve. Do not skip it. A previous run of this prompt
silently deleted hyperlinks because they were "hidden behind" their
visible label text — that must not happen again.

## Step 1 — fetch the current state of the note

Call `get_note(note_id="{note_id}")` and read **`body_html`**. Ignore
`body_text` for editing; it's lossy and will lead you astray.

## Step 2 — inventory what must survive

From `body_html`, list every:

- `<a href="…">` — record each URL and the label so you can verify they
  reappear unchanged in your output.
- `<table>` — note its row/column shape.
- `<ul>` / `<ol>` — note nesting depth and any `☐`/`☑` conventions.
- `<b>`, `<i>`, `<u>`, `<s>` — note where emphasis lives.
- `<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<h3>` — note the section structure.

You will need to confirm that every item in this inventory is present in
your output before you call `update_note`.

## Step 3 — read the styleguide if you'll add new content

If your edit introduces *new* structure (a new section, a new table,
etc.), also load:

- `notes://styleguide`
- `notes://html-reference`

so the additions match what Notes supports.

## Step 4 — produce the edit

- **Strongly prefer `append_to_note`.** It cannot delete existing content.
  Use it whenever the user is adding to the note rather than rewriting it.
- **`update_note` is the dangerous tool.** Only use it when you must
  rewrite content in place. Your new `body` MUST contain every `<a href>`,
  every `<table>`, every `<ul>`/`<ol>`, every emphasis tag from the
  original, unless the user explicitly asked you to remove a specific
  item.
- **Match existing conventions** in the note (heading style, list style,
  metadata-table format, `☐`/`☑` bullets, etc.).
- **Title handling.** The title is the first line of body in Apple
  Notes. Two ways to use `update_note`:
  1. Pass `title="…"` and `body=<content only, no title line>`. The
     MCP prepends `<div>{title}</div>` for you.
  2. Pass `body=` containing the title as the first line yourself.
     The MCP writes your body verbatim.
  Whichever you choose, never end up with two title lines in a row.
  If `body_html` from `get_note` starts with a duplicated title (older
  notes look like `<div>{title}</div><div><b><span ...>{title}</span></b></div>`),
  collapse the duplicate to a single line in your rewrite.
- **Escape user-supplied text**: `&` → `&amp;`, `<` → `&lt;`, `>` → `&gt;`.

## Step 5 — self-check before calling update_note

If you're using `update_note`, compare your output against the inventory
from Step 2:

- Every URL from Step 2 still appears verbatim inside an `<a href="…">`?
- Every table is intact?
- Every list (and its nesting) is intact?
- Every emphasis tag is intact?

If anything in the inventory is missing and the user did NOT ask to
remove it, do not call `update_note`. Either fix the rewrite, or stop
and ask the user for clarification.
